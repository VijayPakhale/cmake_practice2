1. To compile with Compile_executable option, this will avoid changing out CMakeLists.txt file eveytime and we can pass
    the value at run-time
    cmake .. -DCOMPILE_EXECUTABLE=ON

2. Makefile : A just file to do some optional tasks.
    make prepare - This will delete old build dir and create a new one for us.

3. Build in Release/Debug mode:-
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
